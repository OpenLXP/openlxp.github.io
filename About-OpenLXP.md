## What is OpenLXP?
OpenLXP is an open source Learning Experience Platform solution designed to enable discovery of, access to, and reporting on learning experiences.

## What is OpenLXP For?
In July 2018, the DoD Chief Management Officer (CMO) and the Reform Management Group formally initiated the Enterprise Digital Learning Modernization (EDLM) reform initiative. The goal of the EDLM effort is to build an enterprise-wide integrated digital learning ecosystem that enables efficient acquisition and spending management for DoD education and training products and services. The Enterprise Course Catalog (ECC) is one of the three EDLM lines of effort supported by the Advanced Distributed Learning (ADL) Initiative.

Specifically, the ECC is a DoD-wide inventory of education and training assets that federate across local DoD networks and data sources, allowing personnel to use a single interface to access these resources, demonstrated in Figure 1 below. By providing a comprehensive catalog of online course content, the ECC will reduce duplications of effort for learners, training administrators, content developers, and acquisition personnel. ADL currently projects a heterogeneous mix of over 500 internal and external learning systems and environments, representing a near-corresponding amount of divergent learning experience metadata formats. An Enterprise Course Catalog should enable discovery of learning resources by DoD learners that enable access to these learning experiences and enable reporting of learning activities accomplished by such learners.

## What Problem does OpenLXP Solve?
The ADL’s Total Learning Architecture (TLA) data strategy includes three functional pillars—information about specific runtime performance outcomes (Learning Activity), a description of the domain in general (Experiences), and individuals’ aggregate records and personal descriptors over time (Learner Profile) —connected via a fourth pillar (Competencies) that creates a “common currency” for semantic interoperability across the other pillars.

The current architectural goals are defined by the business objectives. Currently, siloed “course” or “experience” systems lead to various issues in accessing available learning opportunities and accessing course catalogs across organizational silos. This places the ECC’s scope squarely in the Experience pillar of the ADL’S TLA data strategy. The business objective is to develop a portal that combines all of the local course catalogs across DoD into a single searchable director for greater accessibility at the time and place of need.

## How does OpenLXP accomplish its Goals?
**Solution Architecture**

Generally speaking, the Enterprise Course Catalog is a learning experience discovery service designed to aggregate metadata describing learning experiences from various internal sources as well as external sources. As the requirements shape further and technologies are decided upon, the future architecture will be defined based on and user functionalities required and the resulting planned ECC components. 
Components are defined as independently-deployable software services which, combined together, comprise the system. Components are made up of one or more software packages, libraries, or modules, depending on the technology stack used to construct the solution; component source code is typically modeled as a repository, although packages, libraries, and modules are also often modeled as repositories as well.   

**ECC Solution Architecture Attributes**

Additionally, as the Deloitte and edX development team design the ECC technical solution, we will work to define an architecture that is in compliance with enterprise architecture principles, best practices, and conceptual target application architectures. To meet these goals, the team will assume the following architecture attributes in the overall solution and future system architecture.
